# UNKNOWN Training Data

The pipeline automatically downloads all training data.
We use a train-dev-test split.
An explanation of the train-dev-test split can be found on <https://cs230.stanford.edu/blog/split/>.
The data loader expects the following structure of the data.

    data/
        test/
            ...
        dev/
            ...
        train/
            ...
